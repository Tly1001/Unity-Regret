# Videogame - Regret

Built with the Unity engine using C#Â fully coded by Me (Thomas Ly), artwork and animations done by Aaron Brown.

It has been a passion project and first attempt using all systems involved for both of us. 

This experience alone has made it worth working on.

Regret is a roguelike featuring themes of time travel, and familial love. 

Each level is based on an era or theme with some warped differences that make sense within the setting of the game.
