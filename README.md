# Videogame - Regret

This project is built with the Unity engine using C#Â fully coded by Me (Thomas Ly) with artwork and animations done by Aaron Brown.

It has been a passion project and first attemp using all systems involved for both of us. 

This experience alone has made it worth working on.

The Game is called Regret, it is a roguelike featuring themes of time travel. 

Each level is based on an era or theme with some warped differences that make sense within the setting of the game.
